# Data Engineering Portfolio
Repository containing Lisa Condoluci's portfolio of data engineering projects. Projects are presented in Jupyter Notebooks using Python and SQL. Many project prompts were from the Data Engineer path in [Dataquest](https://app.dataquest.io/). 

## Contents

__[Building a Database for Crime Reports](https://github.com/lisacondoluci/Data-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/master/Building%20a%20Database%20for%20Crime%20Reports.ipynb)__
* In this project, I build a Postgres database for storing data related to crimes in Boston. Within this database, I create a schema and tables, as well as users and groups to grant permissions. I also optimize each column of this database to improve run times and storage needed. 


__[Optimizing Dataframes and Processing in Chunks](https://github.com/lisacondoluci/Data-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/master/Optimizing%20Dataframes%20and%20Processing%20in%20Chunks.ipynb)__
* In this project, I use Pandas and batch processing to analyze financial lending data. I analyze and convert both string columns and float columns to their optimal types in order to decrease the memory usage needed to read the entire dataset. 


__[Analyzing Startup Fundraising Deals from Crunchbase](https://github.com/lisacondoluci/Data-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/master/Analyzing%20Startup%20Fundraising%20Deals.ipynb)__
* In this project, I use Pandas, batch processing, and SQL in order to analyze a dataset on the fundraising rounds of many startups. I determine memory footprints, optimize all column types, and load the data into a SQLite database. 


__[Exploring Hacker News Posts](https://github.com/lisacondoluci/Data-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/master/Exploring%20Hacker%20News%20Posts.ipynb)__
* In this project, I use Python to analyze posts from Hacker News, a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator. I determine the average number of comments based on the type of post, and I recommend the optimal times of day to post on this site to increase the number of comments. 


__[Building Fast Queries on a CSV](https://github.com/lisacondoluci/Data-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/master/Building%20Fast%20Queries%20on%20a%20CSV.ipynb)__
* In this project, I use Python to define a class and methods to represent an inventory of laptops in a shop. I then optimize these methods in several ways, including by preprocessing the data. 


__[App Analysis](https://github.com/lisacondoluci/Data-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/master/App%20Analysis.ipynb)__
* In this project, I use Python to analyze a dataset of Android and iOS mobile apps that are available on the Google Play Store and App Store. I clean the data by removing duplicate apps and non-English apps, and I create frequency tables to better understand the data and recommend the type of app that should be built in the future. 


__[Analyzing Wikipedia Pages](https://github.com/lisacondoluci/Data-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/master/Analyzing%20Wikipedia%20Pages.ipynb)__
* In this project, I parse and analyze scraped HTML data from Wikipedia pages. I use threads to improve run time for I/O bound programs, and processes to improve run time for CPU bound programs. 


__[Implementing a Key-Value Database](https://github.com/lisacondoluci/Data-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/master/Implementing%20a%20Key-Value%20Database.ipynb)__
* In this project, I use a B-Tree data structure as the building block for a fully functioning, saving-to-disk key-value store.


__[Analyzing Stock Prices](https://github.com/lisacondoluci/Data-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/master/Analyzing%20Stock%20Prices.ipynb)__
* In this project, I work with stock market data from 2007 to 2014. I use various data structures, multiple processes, and binary search algorithms to analyze the data.


__[Answering Business Questions Using SQL](https://github.com/lisacondoluci/Data-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/master/Answering%20Business%20Questions%20Using%20SQL.ipynb)__
* In this project, I use Python's SQLite module to answer business questions about a record store. I define functions to run queries and commands, and write advanced SQL queries, including using CTEs, subqueries, and multiple joins. 


__[Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL](https://github.com/lisacondoluci/Data-Engineering-Portfolio/blob/master/Analyzing%20CIA%20Factbook%20Data%20Using%20SQL.ipynb)__
* In this project, I query a SQLite database in order to analyze factbook data about countries in the world.
